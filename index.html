          <p>If you are so eager to explore this fascinating website that you cannot wait another millisecond, go to <a href="#search">Search</a>, but before clicking on whatever links entice you could you spare a few moments to let me ease you into this unique site?</p>
<p>This is not a typical front page for a major website but this is not a typical website. My goal is not to be slick – and certainly not commercial – but to be uncompromisingly real.</p>
<h5>Finances</h5>
<p>I’m a rarity in that my involvement in the Internet is not some add-on to an otherwise crammed agenda; I give it top priority because – other than <a href="./finances.html">financially supporting myself</a> – I focus solely on this ministry. This is why for the last 17 years I have managed to keep personally reading and promptly replying to <a href="./email.html">e-mails.</a></p>
<h5>co-author</h5>
<p>I’m Grantley Morris, the one who tarnishes God’s glory by being the human component of what I long to be God’s website. I’m the quirky author of many hundreds of large webpages on this site and <a href="./co-author.html">co-author</a> of the rest. <em>NetBurst.Net</em> – equivalent in size to several full length books and the product of decades of work – is my gift to you. There are no charges, no advertisements and <a href="./free.html">donations are not even sought.</a> I would rather go without than miss an opportunity to serve you.</p>
<p>I yearn to so yield to the Lord Jesus that you find every page on <em>Netburst.Net</em> shimmering with the divine and brimming with life-changing truths. Nevertheless, none of us can claim infallibility – and certainly not me. I emphasize this in <a href="./truth.html">Truth: An Awesome Responsibility.</a> You should read that. I don’t want you getting any inflated ideas about me – or anyone else. Rather than con anyone into revering me, I much prefer exposing all my failings. I do this humorously but frankly in <a href="./grantley.html">Who is Grantley Morris?</a> I have slipped, however, if I am in view at all. I want the focus to be solely on God and on everyone he grants me the undeserved privilege of blessing.</p>
<h5>Know</h5>
<p>The Infinite One is not just fiercely passionate and terrifyingly different; he is heart-meltingly warm and soft and approachable <a href="./knowgod.html">More.</a> I ache for the honor of being <a href="./used.html">divinely used</a> to speed you into greater joy, wholeness and fulfillment through an even richer, more exciting intimacy with the God of the universe than you have so far enjoyed.</p>
<p>For those who insist, a deliberately brief outline of <a href="./beliefs.html">my beliefs</a> is provided. It is brief because genuine Christians are vitally important regardless of their doctrinal stance. My goal is not to convert believers to my own doctrinal preferences, nor even to mention them. There are sufficient people with that passion. My heart cry is to encourage, support, and especially to inspire you to fall even more in love with Jesus; enjoying an ever-deepening, more passionate companionship with the One who has all the answers, so that he – and certainly not me – captivates you and leads you into all truth.</p>
<p>Since every Christian is so fervently loved of God as to be of infinite importance to him, I long to avoid even slightly offending any of his precious ones. I do my utmost, but I reel over the appalling reality that merely including something far superior to my thoughts – a Bible text – is a divisive act. No matter what <a href="./version.html">Bible version I quote from,</a> some of God’s beloved will feel offended by the choice.</p>
<h5>Famous</h5>
<p>Likewise, no one can mention a single famous Christian outside the Bible without some believers objecting (see <a href="./famous.html">My Dilemma</a>)</p>
<h5>Hurt</h5>
<p><a href="./hurting-answers-help.html">God’s heart is deeply moved by anyone who is hurting</a>, so I devote many webpages to encouraging people whose suffering is rarely understood by average Christians. I believe the Lord has graciously given me a little insight but again I emphasize my fallibility, in stark contrast to God’s infallibility.</p>
<p>Although most of <em>Netburst.Net</em> is in written form, audios of two of my full length books are provided. Whilst one is primarily for those interested in <a href="./dove/music.html">a music ministry</a>, the other is for everyone: <a href="./book/index.html">Waiting for Your Ministry</a>.</p>
<h5>Pinnacle</h5>
<p>In humor, writing style and several other ways, this book is <a href="./pinnacle.html">the pinnacle of my writing</a>. For sheer entertainment, its only rival is my <a href="./christian-fiction/index.html">fiction</a>, and yet even there I strive not only to entertain but to make it a spiritually moving and enlightening experience.</p>
<p>Although most of the pages are only in English, I’m thrilled that some are available in <a href="./languages/index.html">other languages</a>.</p>

<h3>Search Options</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Make it Supernatural</h5>
<p>Over and over the Bible warns Christians that they can be deceived (<a href="deception.html">Proof</a>). For spiritual truth we must personally seek God’s face. No lazy alternative is safe. Moreover, no one but God knows exactly what parts will transform <em><strong>your</strong></em> life. What you most need might be a few words tucked inside webpages that seem utterly irrelevant, such as a page for singles and another for the sexually abused, when you are married and have never been abused. Elevate the entire experience into a divine encounter by praying as you choose and as you read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sampler</h5>
<p>Selected quotes from the site are arguably the best way to explore the riches within. These <a href="./quotes.html">samplers</a> are so helpful and thought-provoking that I have devoted three long webpages to them. Each quote has a link to the webpage it is taken from, thus enabling you to delve deeper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Related Pages</h5>
<p><em>NetBurst.Net</em> webpages often lead to another webpage and at the end of the series is usually a list of links related to the topic addressed in that series. These links are very helpful and each link will lead to still more links. Since it is easy to get side-tracked following a trail of links I suggest you note the web address of the original list of links so that, when needed, you can return to it to continue your search.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Subject Index</h5>
<p>The <a href="./search.html#subject">Subject Index</a> will take you to a webpage about the topic that interests you but to find further pages on that topic, use the Related Pages listed at the end of the series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Detailed Search</h5>
<p>This can sometimes be helpful but the above alternatives exist because the <a href="./google.html">Exhaustive Search</a> sometimes gives an overwhelming number of options and does not, of course, indicate when another word has been used that means the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Favorites</h5>
<p><a href="./favorites.html">Favorite Webpages</a> can help you get started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Newest Additions</h5>
<p>If you have read almost the entire site (quite a feat) and want to find parts added since you began reading, use <a href="./new.html">Newest Additions</a>.</p>
</li>
